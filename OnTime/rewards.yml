# OnTime Rewards Configuration YAML
# File Version 4.0
# Author: Edge209
#
# This file can be edited manually, or maintained via 'ontime' commands executed from 
# the console or in game.
#
# Format for rewards:
#  - r,p,dd,hh,mm,rdd,rhh,rmm,t,q,reward,perm_string
#
# where:
# r = recurrence: "S" = single
#                 "R" = recurring 
#                 "I" = individual
# 
# p = permission: "A" = All
#                 "E" = Exclusive
#
# dd=reward days
# hh=reward hours
# mm=reward minutes
#  
# rdd=recurrence period days       
# rhh=recurrence period hours      
# rmm=recurrence period minutes    
#
# t = type:  "E" = economy
#            "I" = Item
#            "P" = Permissions     
#            "G" = Group
#            "C" = Command
#
# q = quantity: Only applies to "(I)tem" rewards
#
# reward = reward string
#
# perm_string = permission string (only used when reward 'permission' field set to "E")
#  This string is auto generated by the plugin.  If rewards are defined by hand, then this should be set to to "TBD"
#   so the plugin knows that a code needs to be created.  (e.g.: "- S,A,0,1,0,0,0,0,I,1,DIRT,TBD")
#   The "rewardIDCounter" defined below is used as part of this string, such that every reward ever defined is guaranteed 
#   to have a unique permission string.
#
# example: 
#
#          A set of GroupManager Groups from lowest to highest of Default, Builder, Moderator, and Admin
#
#          a one time player change to permissions group named 'Builder' to be issued at 2 hours
#          a one time econ reward to be issued at 1 day, 0 hours, 0 minutes of 200 coins, exclusive to only some groups
#          a one time econ reward to be issued at 2 days, 8 hours, 10 minutes of 1000 coins
#          a recurring 2 DIAMOND item reward to be issued at 3 days, and every four hours after that
#          a one time command execution of the defined 'xp100' command at 4 days, 0 hours, 0 minutes
