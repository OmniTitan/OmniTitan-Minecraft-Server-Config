# Output Configuration Syntax Rules
# *** BE CAREFUL *** since this is a yml file the format is very important.  NEVER use TABs to create space, always use 'spaces'
#
# Every output string must be contained within single quote marks (')
# Color codes can be used, but codes must begin with "&" and must followed by a space (' ')  e.g. '&a ' for green text
# The number of lines output must be specified (lines: #), or set to zero if no output should be generated.
# Each line must be labeled with 'line-#:' where # is the line order, and # should begin with 1
# "Variables" must be enclosed in "[ ]" and must be proceeded and followed by a space (' ').
#
# The following 'variable' codes are supported in the output:
#
# [afk] - Player's Away from Keyboard (AFK) status. ("(AFK)" shown when AFK, otherwise nothing is displayed.)
# [afktime] - How long a player has been AFK for the current login session
# [current] - Player's OnTime for current session (login)
# [day-week] - Player's daily or weekly OnTime 
# [daysAgo] - Number of calendar days since player's first login to the server
# [daysOn] - The number of different days the player has been on the server
# [lastLogin] - Day/Time stamp of the player's last login
# [player] - Player's in-game name
# [quantity] - Reward quantity value.  Only used for 'item' and 'xp' rewards
# [reward] - Reward to be issued.  (This holds the quantity for 'econ' rewards) 
# [rewardString]** - A default set of reward strings which combine things such as quantity and reward names.
# [rewardType] - Type of reward: Auto vs Individual if Individual Ontime/Real/Delta/Login is also specified
# [timeToReward] - The amount of in-game time until a players next reward is issued
# [total] - Player's total OnTime
# [$] - econ system's unit name (e.g. 'coins', 'dollars', 'credits')
#
#  ** There is special handling for '[rewardString]'.  This was designed to be used in the 'ontime' (self) and 'ontime <playername.' (other) commands.
#      Because it is possible to use the 'ontime rewards set' command a player can have more than one scheduled reward.  When '[rewardString]' is used
#      the plugin will generate multiple lines of the same format, one for each of the scheduled rewards for that player.  Any variable used
#      on the same line will also be used in each of the reward output lines.
