--------------------------- Permissions for CHECKS -----------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These permission nodes are grouped the same way as the options in the config
 file, based on the event type they belong to. The logic is, that a player
 having one of these nodes means he will NOT be checked. Players without the
 permission node will be checked.

 Example: A player has permission "nocheatplus.checks.moving.morepackets". That
 means he is allowed to use that hack/cheat because NoCheatPlus won't check/
 stop it.
